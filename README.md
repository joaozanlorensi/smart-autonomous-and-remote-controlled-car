# projeto-carrinho-inteligente

A project of the Sensors and Actuators class of Electronics Engineering at the Federal University of Technology - Paraná (UTFPR).

## Objective

Build a robot car able to be remotely
controlled while in a "white area" (free control area) and autonomous while in a "black area" (autonomous area).

In the autonomous area, the robot car should look for a RFID device and read it. After that, the robot is then able to go back to being remotely controlled.
